# **Analyze Employee Exit Surveys: Project Overview**
- Analyzed the Employee exit surveys data from employees of Department of Education, Training, and Employment(DETE) and Technical and Further Education(TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia.
- I clean the both of the datasets first and then combined to make it ready for our analysis.
- I particularly analyzed the data to get the answer for following questions:
	- Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?
	- Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?


## Code and Resources Used
**Python Version:** 3.7
**Libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

## Data Cleaning:

- Secondly, we cleaned the data
- Finally, we created categories for length of employment and age.
