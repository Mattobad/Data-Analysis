    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we're going to analyze the exit surveys from employees of [Department of Education, Training and Employment](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-fe96ff30-d157-4a81-851d-215f2a0fe26d/details?q=exit%20survey)(DETE) and the [Technical and Further Eduction](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-89970a3b-182b-41ea-aea2-6f9f17b5907e/details?q=exit%20survey) (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia. We'll be analyzing these datasets combinedly to get the answer for following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in order answer our question we'll be going to perform different data cleaning and data wrangling techniques to get most out of the data. We'll be combining the data from both the source to get the overall idea of exit behavior of the employees. How dissatisfaction plays a role in the employee exit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary of the results**\n",
    "\n",
    "We got an overall idea of longer employeed workers tend to show their dissatisfaction compared to the newer one's. This shows that they are more vocal towards any work related dissatisfaction than other employees. Supported by the data as 80.88% of Employees with Veteran(worked for the company more than 10 years) tag show some kind of dissatisfaction towards their work. This percentage is almost twice compared to employees with new(worked for less than 3 years at the company) tag whose dissatisfaction level is at 47.67%. Our conclusion of longer the year of employment more employees are vocal towards work dissatisfaction is also supported by the increase in dissatisfaction percentage with longer employment.  \n",
